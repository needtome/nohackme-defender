Enhance your WordPress security by blocking IPs that send too many or suspicious requests.

== Description ==

The NoHackMe Defender plugin ensures the security of your WordPress site by blocking IP addresses when receiving suspicious requests, or when too many requests are received from a single IP over a certain period. The plugin offers comprehensive protection mechanisms including:

* Hacking protection: Blocks IP addresses that send suspicious data.
* Parsing protection: Prevents malicious parsing attempts on your website.
* DoS protection: Stops denial-of-service attacks by limiting excessive requests.
* Password brute force protection: Prevents repeated login attempts to guess passwords.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the difference between the free and Premium versions of the plugin? =

The main difference of the Premium version of the plugin lies in the ability to edit lists of suspicious queries, as well as the IP address ranges of Google and Yandex robots. In this regard, you can both delete individual suspicious queries and trusted IP address ranges from these lists and add your own.

Also, in the Premium version of the plugin, there is an option to “one-click” add Google and Yandex robots to the list of trusted IP addresses. That is, not to block Google and Yandex robots if they exceed the limits of the maximum possible number of requests over a period of time.

Otherwise, the free version of the plugin is not limited in any way. And, essentially, purchasing the Premium version of the plugin is just a way to say “thank you” and support the plugin developer.
